Jet setter, go getter, nothing better
Call me Mr. Been there done that
Top model chick to your everyday hood rat
Less than all but more than a few
But I never met one like you
Been all over the world
Done a little bit of everything
Little bit of everywhere
With a little bit of everyone
All the girls I've been with
Things I've seen it takes much to impress
But sho nuf you glow
It makes your soul
Stand out from all the rest, baby
I could be in love but I just don't know
(I) don't know girl
Baby one thing is for certain
Whatever you do is working
Other girls don't matter in your presence
Can't do what you do
There's a million girls around but
I don't see no one but you
You're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had and I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there is ain't nothing better than this
You're not a regular girl
You don't give a damn about the loot
Talking bout I can't do for you
What you can't do for yourself
Even though that ain't so
Baby cause my dough don't know how to end
But that independent thing I'm with it
All we do is win, baby
I could be in love but I just don't know
(I) don't know girl
Baby one thing is for certain
Whatever you do is working
Other girls don't matter in your presence
Can't do what you do
There's a million girls around but
I don't see no one but you
You're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had and I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there is ain't nothing better than this
You're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had and I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there is ain't nothing better than this
Diamond girl
Only one in the world
Ya mine
All I do is think about
what this thing could be
A future baby
Baby you're one of a kind
That means you're the only one for me
Only one for me
Baby cause you're so
You're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had and I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there is ain't nothing better than this
You're so one in a million
You are
Baby you're the best I ever had
Best I ever had and I'm certain that
There ain't nothing better
No there is ain't nothing better than this
